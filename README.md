# Algorithms and Data Structure _my studies about_
## Linear Data Structures (List, Queue and Stack)
###  _"The primary difference between fast and slow algorithms often lies in the choice of appropriate data structures."_
  Data structures are ways of organizing a set of data. They are classified as linear, organized sequentially (one after the other), and non-linear, grouped in a hierarchical form, or in networks. Among the linear structures, we have:
  
   **List:** the simplest structure, organizes data in sequence, without order of removal or addition.
      
   **Queue (FIFO):** follows the order "First in, first out", removing the first in the queue and adding new ones at the end of it.
        
   **Stack: (LIFO):** "Last in, first out", with access only to the top.
